## Design Choices

### Fonts
In order to move away from the basic fonts available, I have used 
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that best suits the feel of the website. For the main text I have chosen [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mon "Montserrat font") as I feel it is has a sharp, simple and easy to read look. To make the headers and the navigation bar stand out form the text, I decided to use [Roboto Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab?query=rob "Roboto Slab font"). This font is complimentary to Montserrat but gives clear definition between text and headers.
