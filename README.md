## Design Choices

### Fonts
In order to move away from the basic fonts available, I have used 
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that best suits the feel of the website. For the main text I have chosen [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mon "Montserrat font") as I feel it is has a sharp, simple and easy to read look. To make the headers and the navigation bar stand out form the text, I decided to use [Roboto Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab?query=rob "Roboto Slab font"). This font is complimentary to Montserrat but gives clear definition between text and headers.

### Icons
I will used some icons for my website from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). These icons will only be used where there is no explination needed to their meaning, social media links, contact links and a hamburger for navigational links on smaller devices. All icons used will be styled and in keeping with the appearance of the website.

### Colours
I have used [Colourmind](https://colormind.io/ "colourmind") to help in the selection of my colour scheme. I selected the initial colour that I wanted the reast of my pallet to fit with and then used the generator to create the pallet, it can be seen [here](wireframes/colour_pallet.JPG "Generated Colour Pallet"). However when I tested the contrast of the colours in [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ "WebAIM"), the contrast ratio from the text colour to the background colour was not good enough and failed tests, they can be seen [here](wireframes/contrast-checker.JPG "Failed tests"). After adjusting the colours manually, I gained a pallet that still gave great impact and had great contrast, these are the results for the contrast checker are [here](wireframes/contrast-checker-adjusted.JPG "Adjusted Colour Pallet").


I will explain the uses of the varius colours below, starting from top to bottom.


![Colour Pallet](wireframes/new-colour-pallet.JPG)


 
 * #8C00B3 - This colour will be used as a background colour for sections and as a text colour.
 * #FFFDDF - This colour will be used as a background colour for sections and as a text colour.
 * #8E689B - This colour will be used on the contact form for added styling.
 * #92579F - This colour will be used as a backgroung behind any images used.
 * #121A18 - This colour will be used as a text colour and also the navigation and footer background colour.

### Structure
I will be building my website with a mobile first mindset using the iPhone 5/SE (320px) as the smallest screen size for styling to look good on. The screen size breakpoints that I will be using are from [Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/ "Bootstrap").

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |
| medium      | => 768px   |
| large       | => 992 px  |
| x-large     | => 1200 px |
# Wireframes
I have used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamic") to develop my wireframes for my website. I initially created the mobile version and then the wireframes and then scalled it up for both tablet and desktop. Because a requirement is to give little but quality information to the user to make them want to engage with the club, a one page website is used. This gets the user through the content and quickly to the contact form and details via scrolling or directly via the navigation bar.

The wireframes are below:
